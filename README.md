# RideChain: Decentralized Rideshare with AI-Enhanced Safety and Ratings

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a decentralized rideshare smart contract which leverages AI in its safety and driver ratings in order to move the rideshare industry out of centralized control. The benefits of this project are higher wages for drivers and lower cost for riders as the removal of centralized control reduces the profits taken out of drivers wages and high costs leveraged on riders. We plan to introduce a smart contract that allows riders to request a ride with the start and end location and other information such as vehicle size, passenger numbers, etc. Once a request is made, matched drivers in the area can accept the ride and propose their price. A rider can then accept the best fare offered. Using the power of a mobile oracle with access to location services, the smart contract will evaluate the promise that the driver successfully drove the rider to their destination. Lastly, in order to maintain the security and reliability of this project, we plan to implement background check technology to ensure drivers and riders are trusted.

## What would be the “Demo” of the project?

The demo for this project would be both driver and user endpoint interactions.

For the driver, we could show an end-to-end process for how a driver could register and become a driver on the platform, obtaining the DID and token, and responding to rider requests. 

For the rider, we could show the process of how a user registers, sets up a route, selects a driver, confirms departure and arrival, and finally uploads the payment and any reviews.  
We would also display the AI model in action updating driver scores based on ride quality.

## End-users and Expected Outcomes

### Drivers
- Can register to be a driver  
- Need to submit data for background check that an oracle completes  
- Can set rates for rides they see available but rider chooses driver  
- Driver class has a score field updated by an external AI using review and ride data  

### Riders
- Can register to be a rider on the app  
- Can send requests for rides  
- Can select any accepted request based on the price offered by the driver

## Responsibilities of each of the team members

- **Faizaan:** Work on the smart contract code for handling background checks via an Oracle  
- **Jordon:** Work on the smart contract code for handling user ride requests and drivers accepting said requests. Potentially work on a mobile device oracle that uses location services to ensure the ride was completed as promised by both parties.  
- **Samir:** Work on training and integrating the AI model using scraped Uber review datasets  

We may rotate around roles once we have a better idea of the tasks at hand. Working together on some portions will also be beneficial in some cases.

## How the team members coordinate to work on the project

We will be working on this project Wednesdays and weekends when we all have the most free time. We will use Discord for group calls and meet at the RPI Union when necessary, aiming for at least once a week on Wednesdays.

## Asynchronous communication channel (Discord/Webex)

We are pretty good about calling and texting as our main source of communication. We also may use Discord or Webex if we need to live share code or something along those lines.
