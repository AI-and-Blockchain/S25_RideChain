TO DO LIST:

Smart Contract Component:
- Currently, the only file that needs to be tweaked is the ride_registration contract.
- Ride registration structs and data need to be moved and stored in this contract. Only allowed contracts should be allowed to interface with ride_registration.
- All other files that did the tasks of this contract now need to interface with it accordingly with the sequence and component diagram.

- Link up smart contracts and test on forge.



AI Component:



Mobile Oracle Component:
- Research and start finding a way to do this. Get it implemented and interfaced with by the end of the project.
